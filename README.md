# Restaurant Database Project README

This project is focused on the development of a comprehensive restaurant database system. This project embodies the culmination of practical database skills, including data modeling, schema design, SQL query development, and the use of advanced database features such as functions, procedures, triggers, and views.

## Project Overview

This project was initiated with a thorough design phase, where we first constructed the data model and schema to accurately represent the intricacies of a restaurant operation. The design phase included detailed planning of the relationships between tables to ensure a robust and scalable database.

Following the design, we ventured into the realm of relational algebra and Datalog, crafting simple queries to manipulate and interact with the data structure we envisioned. This theoretical foundation paved the way for the practical implementation phase.

Using MySQL Workbench, we brought our design to life by creating the database and implementing a wide range of SQL queries. Our queries demonstrate a variety of SQL features, including but not limited to joins, grouping, unions, nested queries, functions, procedures, triggers, and views. Our approach ensured a dynamic and interactive database, catering to the complex needs of a restaurant management system.

### Technical Details

- **Database Management System (DBMS):** MySQL
- **Design and Development Tool:** MySQL Workbench
- **Schema Design:** Utilized normalization principles for optimal database design, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
- **Table Relationships:** Implemented various relationships between tables, including one-to-many and many-to-many, to reflect real-world interactions within a restaurant's operations.

### Documentation

- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram:** Included in the repository is a picture depicting the ER diagram, which outlines the data model and schema design of our restaurant database.
- **Process Documentation:** A comprehensive file detailing the step-by-step process of creating the database, from schema design to the implementation of various SQL features, is provided to guide readers through our development journey.
